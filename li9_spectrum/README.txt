Note by unknown author, unknown date: I am not sure what are we using. I recently used BCW files and 5.5% He8 contribution to generate new nominal spectra

MK's note: Contrary to the above, the 8he9li_nominal_spectrum.root (used for P17B) was made using the IHEP (not BCW) model for electrons/gammas/electronics, still with 5.5% He8.
